Re: Donation for Qualified Foster Children – Back-to-School Support and Winter Clothes and Kinship Program.
Dear Travis,
Enclosed please find a check in the amount of $50,000 to support qualified foster children and the kinship program members in Somerset County.
These funds are to be used as follows:
* $38,250 is designated to purchase 170 L.L. Bean gift cards to provide back-to-school supplies and winter clothing for qualified foster children in the Somerset County Snowbusters Program.

* The remaining $11,750 is to be used for gift cards to benefit children who are part of the Kinship Program and receiving care from their grandparents.

I appreciate the great work you do to help foster children and Kinship families, and I am proud to partner with you in making a difference in Somerset County.
Please feel free to contact me if you need additional information or confirmation of how the funds should be distributed.




With great appreciation,
