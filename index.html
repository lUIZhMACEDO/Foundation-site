                    <p>Founded by Al King III, our foundation is built on the principles of community service, compassion, and giving back.

                    <p>Our foundation supports various charitable purposes with a special focus on Maine communities, particularly Fairfield, where Al King III grew up and where his parents, Allie W. King Jr. and Gerri King, were lifelong residents. We believe that strong communities are built through the dedication of individuals who care deeply about the welfare of others.</p>

                    <h2>Our History</h2>
                    <p>Al King III's journey began with humble beginnings in rural Maine, where he learned the values of hard work, perseverance, and community from an early age. Growing up in Fairfield, Al experienced firsthand the challenges and opportunities that come with rural life, shaping his deep understanding of what communities need to thrive.</p>
                    <p>Through decades of dedication and hard work, Al built a successful career and founded South Dakota Trust Company, establishing himself as a respected leader in the financial services industry. Despite his professional success, Al never forgot his roots or the values instilled in him by his parents, Allie W. King Jr. and Gerri King, who were lifelong members of the Fairfield community.</p>
                    <p>His parents believed deeply in giving back to their community, and Al's foundation continues their legacy of service and support. Having achieved success through his own determination, Al is now committed to helping others who are working to overcome challenges and build better lives for themselves and their families.</p>
                    <p>Through generous contributions and thoughtful grant-making, the Al King III Foundation continues to make a meaningful impact in communities, particularly in Maine, where the King family has deep roots and lasting connections. Al's story serves as an inspiration that with hard work, determination, and a heart for service, anyone can achieve success and make a difference in their community.</p>
